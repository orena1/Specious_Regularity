# Specious_Regularity
This repository contains the full analysis code for the results of the [From choice architecture to choice engineering (Ohad Dan & Yonatan Loewenstein)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10825-6) competition. The code is used to create the publication "Nudging with Regularity" (Shani-Narkiss, H., Eitam, B., Amsalem, O.). All figures in the paper are automatically generated.

To recreate the analysis, download the raw data supplied by the competition organizers on  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sSlBhdsVyycRpMU5o9AW8dJiltrCIwH6).
Open the analysis [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/orena1/Specious_Regularity/blob/main/Specious_Reg_Nudge_Ind.ipynb) Then, open the analysis Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions to recreate all the figures used in the paper.
